# 🐍 Python Practice Tasks

Welcome to the **Python Practice Tasks** repository! 🎉 This collection of Python tasks is designed to help you practice and enhance your skills in basic Python concepts. Whether you're just getting started or looking to brush up on your Python skills, this repo provides simple yet effective exercises. 🧑‍💻✨

## 📋 Tasks Overview

### 🧮 **Task 1: Basic Arithmetic Operations**
- Perform basic arithmetic operations on two numbers (`x = 4` and `y = 5`), including:
  - Addition ➕
  - Subtraction ➖
  - Multiplication ✖️
  - Division ➗
  - Modulus %

### 🧮 **Solution:
  x = 4
y = 5
print(x+y)
print(x-y)
print(x*y)
print(x/y)
print(x % y)

### 🔍 **Task 2: Comparison Operations**
- Compare two variables (`age1 = 30`, `age2 = 25`) using comparison operators:
  - Greater than `>`
  - Less than `<`
  - Equality check `==`

### 🧮 **Solution:

  age1 = 30
age2 = 25
print(age1 > age2)
print(age1 < age2)
print(age1 == age2)

### 🔢 **Task 3: Odd or Even Check**
- Check if a given number is even or odd. Example: Given `num1 = 10` and `num2 = 2`, determine if the result is even or odd.

### 🧮 **Solution:
num1 = 10
num2 = 2
modulus = num1 % num2
if modulus == 0:
    print("number is even")
else:
    print("number is odd")

### 💪 **Task 4: Power Operation**
- Calculate the result of one number raised to the power of another, e.g., `num1 = 5` and `num2 = 3`. Use the exponentiation operator `**`.

### 🧮 **Solution:

num1 = 5
num2 = 3
print(num1**num2)

### 🌡️ **Task 5: Temperature Conversion (Celsius to Fahrenheit)**
- Convert a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula:  
  `F = (C * 9/5) + 32`, where `C = 44`.

### 🧮 **Solution:

C = 44
F = (C * 9/5) + 32
print("Temperature in Fahrenheit.")
print(F)
